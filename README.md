# IfYouAreBlank: RAG-Based Movie Recommendation System
## Introduction
IfYouAreBlank is a sophisticated movie recommendation system that leverages a combination of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo, text-embedding-3-small model, and Pinecone's vector database to deliver narrative-driven movie suggestions. Inspired by queries from Reddit's r/MovieSuggestions, this system allows users to input detailed descriptions of their movie preferences, and utilizes a RAG system to generate tailored movie recommendations.


## Features
- Narrative-Driven Queries: Accepts user input in a freeform narrative style to capture detailed preferences.
- Advanced NLP Models: Utilizes GPT-3.5 Turbo for understanding and processing user queries.
- Vector Database: Employs Pinecone to manage and retrieve movie data efficiently through vector embeddings.
- Dynamic Interaction: Allows iterative query refinement to hone in on user preferences for more accurate recommendations.
